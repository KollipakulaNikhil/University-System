📘 University Course Registration & Timetabling System

A full-stack web application for managing university academic processes, including course registration, timetabling, attendance tracking, grading, and disciplinary actions.
Designed with transactional safety, role-based access, and real-time seat availability.

🚀 Features
👨‍🎓 Students

View available courses & sections

Register for sections (with:

seat availability

timetable clash detection

View personal timetable

View grades

View attendance percentage

Blocked access when suspended

👨‍🏫 Instructors

Manage assigned sections

Create sections (time, room, capacity)

View enrolled students

Enter grades

Mark attendance (Present/Absent/Excused)

Report disciplinary issues

🛡️ Admins

Dashboard with system-wide analytics

🏛️ System Logic

The system follows a strict academic workflow:

1️⃣ Admin creates Program & Course
2️⃣ Instructor creates Section (time, room, seat limit)
3️⃣ Student registers
4️⃣ Transaction updates seat count safely
5️⃣ Student gets timetable + grades + attendance

🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Role	Permissions
Admin	Full control of system & academic entities
Instructor	Manages sections, attendance, grades
Student	Registers for sections, views timetable, grades, attendance

# University Course Registration & Timetabling System

A comprehensive full-stack web application for managing university academic processes, including course registration, timetabling, grading, disciplinary actions, and attendance tracking.

## 🚀 Features

### User Roles
- **Students**: 
  - View available courses and sections.
  - Register for courses (with conflict detection).
  - View personal timetable.
  - View grades and attendance statistics.
  - Blocked access when suspended.
- **Instructors**:
  - Manage assigned sections.
  - View enrolled students.
  - Enter grades.
  - Mark attendance (Present/Absent/Excused).
  - Report disciplinary issues.
- **Admins**:
  - Dashboard with system analytics.
  - Manage users (Students, Instructors).
  - View and resolve disciplinary reports (Suspend/Revoke Suspension).
  - Manage courses and sections.

### Key Functionalities
- **Transactional Enrollment**: Ensures data integrity during high-concurrency registration periods, with deadlock simulation and resolution.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure access to features based on user roles (Student, Instructor, Admin).
- **Disciplinary System**: Full workflow for reporting, suspending, and revoking suspensions for students.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Instructors can mark attendance, and students can view their attendance percentage per course.
- **Real-time Availability**: Dynamic updates of seat availability in course sections.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React framework), Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons).
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes (Serverless functions).
- **Database**: MySQL (relational database).
- **Authentication**: [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) (Credentials provider).
- **Language**: TypeScript.
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- MySQL Client (optional, for manual DB inspection)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd university-system
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=university_user
    DB_PASSWORD=university_password
    DB_NAME=university_db
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```

### Database Setup

1.  **Start MySQL Container:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2.  **Initialize Database Schema:**
    ```bash
    npx ts-node scripts/init_db.ts
    ```
    *Note: This script applies the initial schema and seeds default data.*

3.  **Apply Additional Schema Updates:**
    ```bash
    npx ts-node scripts/update_schema.ts
    npx ts-node scripts/update_schema_revocation.ts
    npx ts-node scripts/update_schema_attendance.ts
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Access the App:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Default Credentials (Seeded Data)

- **Admin**: `admin@university.com` / `admin123`
- **Instructor**: `instructor@university.com` / `password123`
- **Student**: `student@university.com` / `password123`

## 🧪 Verification & Testing

- **Scripts**: Various scripts in `scripts/` are available for testing database integrity, checking users, and simulating deadlocks.
- **Browser Tool**: Automated verification steps are documented in `walkthrough.md`.

## Cloud Deployment (Vercel)

When deploying to Vercel, you must use a cloud database (e.g., Aiven, PlanetScale) instead of a local one.
Configure the following Environment Variables in Vercel:
- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_USER`
- `DB_PASSWORD`
- `DB_NAME`
- `DB_PORT`
- `DB_SSL` (set to "true")
